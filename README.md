Cellshape-cloud is an easy-to-use tool to analyse the shapes of cells using deep learning and, in particular, graph-neural networks. The tool provides the ability to train popular graph-based autoencoders on point cloud data of 2D and 3D single cell masks as well as providing pre-trained networks for inference.
